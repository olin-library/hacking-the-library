### Code Complete

Due the evening of Friday, March 16. (As a practical matter, I won't look at
your code until Saturday March 17 at the earliest. But, I wake up very early…)

* Github repositories are ready for review.
* The README must contain instructions that will allow someone familiar with
  git and the command line to run the application on their computer.
  * Stretch goal: The README documents how to set up a computer
    to run without external resources.
  * Stretch goal: The README documents how to provision the external resources
    required to run a new instance of the application, that doesn't share any
    resources with existing instances.
  * Note that one of these stretch goals may be required in order to let us run
    your code, unless you share your third-party credentials with us.
