The current project is [The

**Before the start of class**, submit your survey, team reflection, and practice
area write-up. The survey link and further instructions will be posted to Slack.

**By 8pm**, your Github repo should be be ready for inspection. I'll update the assignment page with more details about what I'm be looking for.
