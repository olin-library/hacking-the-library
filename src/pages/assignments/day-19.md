## Homework for Today

* Read [BRD, PRD, TRD… The case of the confusing requirements.](https://medium.com/@TylerLogtenberg/brd-prd-trd-the-case-of-the-confusing-requirements-cebd5e54ff2b)
* Review [ABE Product Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lz7lsibd7zK_rMsybPkeTqk0Dfg38Lt5uspNbQes9mw/edit).
  * _Scribble on it!_ You can probably find requirements that you don't think
    are necessary for a Minimal Awesome Product; or things that _are_ necessary
    but aren't listed as requirements; or requirements that simply aren't clear.
    Mark up at least one of these.
  * _Trace it!_ Are there current or planned features that don't implement
    requirements? Then update either the product plans, or the requirements,
    until they are in sync.

### Clarifications

The intent is that you engage with and contribute to the document.

**Scribble on it.** Look hard enough to find an error of commission or omission (something false, or something missing), and fix it or leave a comment. If you look hard and don’t see anything, you can say this instead.

**Trace it.** Check your project plan against the requirements. If you’re planning a task that doesn’t implement a requirement, this is a defect in the plan or in the requirements — fix it or make a note. Similarly if there’s a requirement in the area that you’re implementing, that isn’t present in the current software or task list, note or fix this.
