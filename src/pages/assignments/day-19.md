## Homework for Today

* Read [BRD, PRD, TRD… The case of the confusing requirements.](https://medium.com/@TylerLogtenberg/brd-prd-trd-the-case-of-the-confusing-requirements-cebd5e54ff2b)
* Review [ABE Product Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lz7lsibd7zK_rMsybPkeTqk0Dfg38Lt5uspNbQes9mw/edit).
  * Scribble on it! You can probably find requirements that you don't think
    are necessary for a Minimal Awesome Product; or things that _are_ necessary
    but aren't listed as requirements; or requirements that simply aren't clear.
    Mark up at least one of these.
  * Trace it! Are there current or planned features that don't implement
    requirements? Then update either the product plans, or the requirements,
    until they are in sync.
