## Due Thursday

* Read [Holding a Program in One's Head](http://paulgraham.com/head.html). Think about:
  1. Is there one of these that you feel you've mastered?
  2. Is there one you'd like to learn?
* Enter your team members and GitHub repo URL on the [Team Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NrAKDvwG1vEoD9GZaBf-LCuogwBVzA0khK1jYVhkvwk/edit?usp=sharing).

**We will also meet on Wednesday.**
