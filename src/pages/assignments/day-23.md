## For Class

Be prepared with your demo, as discussed last Thursday.

## In Class

Review these questions  weâ€™ll be brain-writing to them during the session!

1. What is the role for libraries in countering online mis- and dis-information?
2. What is our role in ensuring that the archival materials we all are
   collecting and highlighting are relevant for contemporary discussions? (I
   shared thoughts  on this topic last week.)
3. How would we construct a virtual library if we were starting from scratch?
4. How should we re-imagine the physical library as we shift from handling
   analog materials to digital ones?
5. How can we better understand the implications of living so much of our lives
   on, and providing so much of our data to, privately-owned networks?
6. Is the shift to digital material and platforms changing the ways in which we
   learn?
7. How can we use in-person engagements to make digital resources more
   accessible and relevant?
8. How can we ensure that the opportunities of the digital age are as accessible
   to marginalized communities, including rural America, as they are to everyone
   else?
9. How can the Digital Public Library of America contribute to efforts to
   advance diversity and inclusion in librarianship?
10. How can the DPLA more effectively support the work of others in the field?
