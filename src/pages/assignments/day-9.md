### Reading

[UML 2 Deployment Diagrams: An Agile Introduction](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/deploymentDiagram.htm)

### Writing (er, Drawing)

Create a [deployment diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_diagram) for your project.

This can go in your project proposal document, or Github README. Or, host it elsewhere (e.g. [Gliffy](https://www.gliffy.com/)) and *link* to it from one of the aforementioned roots.

The [UML Diagrams resources page](https://github.com/olin-build/olin.build/wiki/UML-Diagrams) contains additional links to UML readings and tools.
