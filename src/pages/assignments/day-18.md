The goal of the following activities is to come into class ready to plan and begin work on a (probably one-week) project sprint. For Monday:

**Back-End** and **Web Calendar** teams:

* Decide on a project tracking system, e.g. Trello, the existing GitHub project board, or a new GitHub project board. The current ABE (back end) board is [here](https://github.com/olinlibrary/ABE/projects/1). The current ABE-web (calendar) board is [here](https://github.com/olinlibrary/abe-web/projects/1), but this is named ‚ÄúUI Fixes‚Äù ‚Äî either rename it, or start another.
* If you're starting from an existing board, it may already have columns whose names or contents don't match your project management. Take ownership: rename columns, and move items, to match your short-term plans. (It's okay if lots of stuff goes in the backlog; we'll review it against release milestones at the next sprint.)
* Each team member: select a [deployment question](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSL6GxbiXml-8EWrXcbJtWrEhM8BFYz4wnmFAcTc-0M/edit#), and answer it for your project. Enter your answers in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSL6GxbiXml-8EWrXcbJtWrEhM8BFYz4wnmFAcTc-0M/edit#heading=h.r21ypx9p7f44). You may work with other team members (or people not on your team too) ‚Äî but acknowledge sources and contributors; and there should be (at least) one answer per person. Your answer should include:
  * What is the current answer?
  * What would a better answer be?
  * Where did you look to find the answer?
  * What could or should be changed to make it easier for a future developer or operator to find the answer?
* The previous exercise is intended to solicit thoughts about tasks that are required for launch. Add these tasks to your project tracker.
* The answers to some questions are specific to a particular deployment, rather than to the project source repo. Blank starter documents for collecting information about our deployments are [here (ABE)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VJZyJAFj4AxppUNVnEn4desoa0Gz1LtF9Pl0M6Fvwt8/edit#) and [here (web calendar)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6zezjW1n8rUYdlmn9YkkX2YdsfkpbY3c6Jqk1t1BYY/edit#). Don't put passwords and other secrets in them; another solution may be provided for that.

**New **üé© team:

Come in with a written document that answers:

* What is your project name (if different from ‚ÄúNew üé©‚Äù)?
* What is the main idea of your project?
* What features are required from Minimal Awesome Product (MAP)
* For each team member, what are your learning objectives?
* What is the first task that each team member will work on?
