## Agenda

 10–10:30am — retrospective, and setup for visitors, and food
 10:30–11am — visitors, presentations and demos, more food
 11–11:30am [optional] — what’s next with ABE? Planning for the future. Probably no food.

# Presentations

 If you would like to show/share your work, please add your name to [this Google
 doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vzt3hDrrgXKZwFW706OC1aF3j0KNH-3WUb16eyK4cfs/edit).
 In particular I am looking for volunteers to insure that ABE and abe-web are
 presented, and some projects from earlier in the semester.

 Presentations may be any combination of: a slide deck, a demo on a screen, a
 demo on a device or hardware platform (bear, harvester).

 The purpose of this time slot is to celebrate your work, and inspire and
 satisfy the curiosity of our visitors.

 Presentations and demos are for you to shine and for the benefit of the
 community. They are optional, and they are not assessed.
