## Course Expectations

This is a 4 credit course.
That means that the average well-prepared student keeping up with the coursework should expect to spend 12 hours a week on this course.

## Attendance

Unlike some of the classes that we teach at Olin, HtL attendance is expected.
Much of this course does not have a textbook. It does not even have a fixed syllabus.
What happens in the classroom will not be entirely predictable nor will the critical points necessarily be replicated elsewhere.
If you miss class, you will be missing something that cannot be made up.
At the same time, your participation in class provides us with critical feedback; the course as a whole will suffer if you are not there.

Please note that attendance means mentally as well as physically. If you get yourself into a position where you will simply not be able to absorb the content of the class, it may be better not to come. If this happens once, we will likely overlook it. If it happens regularly, we will feel entitled to conclude that you are not taking the participation requirement seriously.

We do understand that conflicts arise. We expect that you will let us know substantially in advance of any class session that you will unavoidably miss. ("Substantially in advance" means as soon as you know it yourself. Email is the best way to let us know as it also creates a record.) We further expect that you will make arrangements to obtain as full a report as possible from a classmate and that you will take complete responsibility for any missed content.

## Collaboration Policy

All collaboration must be acknowledged.
This includes anyone who has helped you with your work or contributed to it and any resources that you may have consulted in order to complete this assignment. Unacknowledged collaboration is illicit collaboration and may have consequences ranging from grade penalty to honor board action.

## Course Components

Your evaluated work in this course will include:

| Activity                          | Weight |
|-----------------------------------|--------|
| Labs                              | 15%    |
| Mini-Projects                     | 30%    |
| Final Project                     | 45%    |
| Participation and Professionalism | 10%    |

## Mini-Projects

During the first third of the semester, you will be working in groups of two or three on a series of mini-projects.
Each mini-project group will present their work at the end of the mini-project period.

## Final Project

During the last two thirds of the semester, you will be working in a group of three to four students bringing one of the mini-projects to a deliverable state.

## Late Policy

Late assignments and project deliverables will be penalized at a rate of up to 10% per day or fraction thereof.
Extensions requested at least 24 hours before the due date will almost always be granted.
With the exception of unforeseeable events such as illness or family emergency, extensions requested within 24 hours of a due date will not be granted.

[Portions of this course policy were adapted from Lynn Stein's 2017 FOCS course and from the Fall 2016 POE policy, both offered at Olin College.]
