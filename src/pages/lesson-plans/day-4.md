## Part I

In the first bit of class we’ll discuss the film. Come in ready to share:

* 2-3 “Jobs” Patrons were “Hiring” NYPL to do
* A reflection on something new you saw in libraries because of the film.

## Part II

We will discuss [Holding a Program in One’s Head]( http://www.paulgraham.com/head.html). Be ready to discuss:

* Is there one of these that you feel you’ve mastered?
* Is there one you’d like to learn?

We will have studio time.  After some time of heads down work,  Oliver and I will visit your group, where we’ll want to hear:

* Your proposal
* The steps you will take to get there
