This page lists resources that are available to for development of projects from the
[Course Book](/files/HtL_web-book-1.pdf).  Some of these are suitable for use in a final
project; some are suitable for prototyping with during exploration, and can be replaced
by supported hardware for projects that are selected for further development.


## Slack and Chat

This [wiki page](https://github.com/olinlibrary/hackingthelibrary.org/wiki/Chat-resources) collects Slack and chat / conversation agent libraries and services.

During exploration, we have a sandbox Slack domain https://olin-library.slack.com that we can make
everyone an adminstrator of. Once a project is developed, we can connect a production version to the
Olin Slack team.


## Digital Signage

Duncan is developing software to integrate class projects with digital signage.
If your application lives at a public URL, we will be able to display it on the
digital signs in the lobby. Depending on the project, we may extend this basic API
to allow for controlling applications.

The library has two iPads and two Samsung tablets that can be positioned as temporary signs
during development.


## Sonos (music and audio)

[SoCo (Sonos Controller)](http://python-soco.com) is a simple Python class that allows you to programmatically control Sonos speakers.

[This blog post](http://www.nooganeer.com/his/projects/homeautomation/make-sonos-speak/) describes
a fork that allows you to play an uploaded MP3 file, such as one generated by Google Text to Speech
or an audio synthesis program.

The library has Sonos speakers.



## SMS

There's also good support for writing an chat bot that uses SMS.
Twilio is a service that provides programmatic SMS and voice capabilities;
the official Python library is [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python);
a quick start tutorial is [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python/sms).


## Voice over phone

Twilio also provides programmatic support for speech, using the same library.
A tutorial is [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python/twiml).


## People Counters

The library has two [All-Tag Bi-Directional People Counters](http://all-tag.com/product-category/people-counters/), one at each entrance.

We haven't explored gaining programmatic access to this â€“
some altnernatives with less risk for a mini-project exploration:

* Install laptops with webcams
* Install motion detectors or proximity sensors


## Design Patterns
ðŸŽ‰ Ultra-simplified explanation to design patterns! ðŸŽ‰ A topic that can easily make anyone's mind wobble. Here I try to make them stick in to your mind (and maybe mine) by [explaining them in the simplest way possible](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans/blob/master/README.md).
