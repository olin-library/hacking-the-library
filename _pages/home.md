## Thursday: Sprint Reviews

Be prepared to present the state of your project, progress since last week, and plans for the next week of work.

In keeping with the "more frequent, shorter reviews" experiment, reviews need be no longer than 5-10 minutes. You can take up to twenty minutes if it will be helpful.
