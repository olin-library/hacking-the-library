## (Today) Thursday
For [Sprint Review desk visits](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9FJwQCaWu5qD90a5xMgP_z_cGQ3y8K54vf9gB3X_ss/edit), please bring:
* Product definition. What features will the end-of-semester software implement?
* Project risks. What risks, technical or otherwise, could keep this project from demonstrating that this is a viable direction, and from being adorable and adoptable.
* Project roadmap. What features will come in over what time; what technical work supports these?
* One week plan. What will you work on over the coming week?
