## Hacking the Library

<i>Help us create a new kind of Library</i>

This course leverages the Olin Library and the areas of civic and community software as platforms on which to explore topics in software production, deployment, and operations.

This is a studio course, with workshops, readings, and discussion around production development and operations as well as libraries. Topics will be guided by the specific projects chosen. Projects will be developed by individuals and teams; we will meet regularly to understand the goals and interactions between the projects. Instructors will guide learning of software development that supports both prototyping and robust working systems, as well as design methods.

This course begins where many courses leave off.  We will both start new projects and work with existing projects in order to learn concepts that apply to different stages of the software project lifecycle.

## Prerequisites

Software Design or Permission of Instructor.  If you’re passionate, give us a call.

## Prototype to Production

* **Documentation, Testing, and Continuous Integration**: Techniques for developing test and documentation suites, that grow along with your software and guide its construction.
* **Identity, Authorization, Privacy, Security**: How can code protect access to sensitive data? How can it it know who you are?
* **Dev Ops** (staging and production environments; continuous delivery; logging and monitoring; analytics): It’s one thing to run code on your laptop. How can you understand and monitor what it does in the cloud?

## Community Technology

* **Community Technology**: What is the nature of software that grows out of Libraries, not Silicon Valley? Software that defies scalability - more intranet than internet?
* **Projects that Escape the Semester**: Our ambition is to to create systems, artifacts, and smart spaces that impact the Olin community beyond the semester.
* **Standing on the Shoulders of**: Projects will draw on work from last year’s course offering, from the Software of Summer, current Library Software and from select Open Source projects in the wild.
