Your team will have 20 minutes to present your project plan.

The purpose of the presentation is to familiarize the class with the design and technical content of your product, and to get feedback on questions, issues, and problems.

Your presentation should answer the following questions:
1. What is the Product Vision?
2. What is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?
3. What are the Stretch Goals?
4. What is the Implementation Plan?
  * What libraries, technologies, and services will you be using?
  * What is the provisional technical architecture?
  * What do you expect to have done for the next review (Thursday March 23)?
5. What are the design and technical risks?
