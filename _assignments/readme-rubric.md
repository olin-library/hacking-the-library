# Project Artifacts

The home page of your project should include or link to the following. These can be embedded in the README, GitHub pages, or the project site itself. It's more important *to document these at all* and to *create a path to them*, then *how* or *where* they're documented.

## Marketing

**Project Vision**. What is the big idea? What inspired this? Consider screenshots and video.

**Appliction Web Site**. Link to the web site (if your project has one).

## User

**Self-demo instruction**. How can I use this? What should I try? Consider re-using material from your demo script.

**Current status** (from a user perspective). What works; what's broken? Just enough to tell a user how to kick the tires.

## Product Manager

**Project Status**. What is your vision for the roadmap – notes on ideas and suggestions; what

**License**. [Add one](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/).

**Known bugs**. (Minor issues that people are unlikely to run into can be marked by FIXME comments in the source code.)

**Credits and acknowledgement**. Who wrote this? Who contributed ideas? Did you use external resources (code, assets) – credit them?

## Developer

**Installation instructions** (for local development). How to set up a development environment; how to run the application.

**Technical documentation**. Architecture, guide to file and directory structure, link to documentation. Use flowcharts and architectural, class, or sequence diagrams to explain how your code works.

**Developer cookbook**. How to run the tests. How to add to the documentation. Are there common tasks that you as developer have needed to do, to debug or iterate on the application? Capture these here. (If there's just one or two items, they can go in the README. If there's more, consider a separate page,)

[Optional] **Contribution guidelines**. Style guide (can link to external resource). How to add documentation and tests (can link to systems used for these.)

**Future work** (developer perspective). What would you do to make the code cleaner / more maintainable if you had time? Minor issues can be marked by TODO comments in the source code.

## Operator

**How to deploy** to the cloud. What resources to provision and how to configure them. Does this app depends on third-party services? How are these configured and how is the app configured to point to them?

**Runbook**. How to perform different administrative tasks. What kinds of maintenance have you needed to do? What are some failure modes, and where to look / what to change when these occur?
