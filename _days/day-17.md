Today we are going to create a scaffold for project documentation.

We will use the [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) documentaton framework, which enables for themes, indexed hierarchical documentation, API documentation, and a variety of output formats.

Sphinx integrates with the (free) [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) service, that provides free hosting for your documentation, and makes it discoverable.
