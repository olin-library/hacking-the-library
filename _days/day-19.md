Today we are going to create a scaffold for project testing.
You will add to this test suite over the course of your project.

The motivation is to make project testing a first-class element of your deliverables, so that (1) you deliver a project that can be not just executed but maintained; so that (2) work that goes into the test cases can inform the organization of your code; and so that (3) you have the option of trying out [test-driven development](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html).
